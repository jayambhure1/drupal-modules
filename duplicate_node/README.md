INTRODUCTION
------------

Duplicate Node Layout & Block is used to duplicate node with all fields.

If the layout builder is enabled for this node, then the layout is also duplicated.

If inside the node layout any custom block is placed, this also duplicates, and this block is linked to the duplicate node, so users can easily edit the duplicate block. 

CONFIGURATION
-------------

    1. Navigate to Administration > Extend and enable the Duplicate Node
       module.
    2. A Duplicate tab is now available on nodes.
    3. Select the Duplicate tab and a new node is created and the fields from the
       previous node are populated.
    4. Make appropriate edits and Save New Duplicate.
